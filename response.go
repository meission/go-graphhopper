GraphHopper Directions API

 Integrate A-to-B route planning, turn-by-turn navigation, route optimization, isochrone calculations, location clustering and other tools into your application.    ##### Authentication      1. [Sign up for GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/signup)   2. [Create an API key](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976027)    Authenticate to the API by passing your key as a query parameter in every request.    ##### API Explorer    You can also try all API parts without registration in our [API explorer](https://explorer.graphhopper.com/).    ##### Client Libraries    To speed up development and make coding easier, we offer a [JavaScript client](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client) and a   [Java client](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/client-hc).    ##### Optimize Response Speed    1. Reuse SSL/TLS sessions    You should utilize the SSL session to speed up responses after the initial response or use a library that does this. E.g. for Java the   [OkHttp library](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) automatically reuses SSL/TLS sessions and also the browser takes care of this automatically.   For python you can use the [`requests` library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/): first you create a   session (`session = requests.Session()`) and then do requests only with this session instead of directly using \"requests\".    2. Bandwidth reduction    If you create your own client, make sure it supports http/2 and gzipped responses for best speed.   If you use the Matrix, the Route Optimization API or the  and want to solve large problems, we recommend you to reduce bandwidth   by [compressing your POST request](https://gist.github.com/karussell/82851e303ea7b3459b2dea01f18949f4) and specifying the header   as follows: `Content-Encoding: gzip`. This will also avoid the HTTP 413 error \"Request Entity Too Large\".
